# Countdown Game

A collection of three simple countdown games I made in Python. Test your guessing skills and reaction time!

## Games

1. **Simple Countdown Timer** - Pick a number and watch it count down to zero
2. **Guess the Countdown** - Try to guess what number the countdown started from
3. **Stop at Zero Challenge** - Press Enter at exactly the right moment when it hits zero

## How to Play

1. Make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed
2. Download or clone this repo
3. Run the game:
```
python countdown_game.py
```
4. Choose which game you want to play from the menu

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- That's it! Uses only built-in modules (`time` and `random`)

## Files

- `countdown_game.py` - All three games in one file
- `README.md` - You're reading it

- ## 🆕 New Features

### 🏆 Reaction High Scores
The *Stop at Zero Challenge* now tracks your best reaction time (fastest). Each time you play, your best time is displayed!

### 🔁 Replay Support
After finishing any game, just press Enter to return to the menu — no need to restart the program.

### 🎯 Expanded Guess Range
The *Guess the Countdown* game now selects numbers from 5 to 25 to make guesses more varied.

### 🛠 Improved Prompts
Inputs and error messages have been clarified for a smoother experience.
