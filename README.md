# Countdown Game

A collection of three simple countdown games I made in Python. Test your guessing skills and reaction time!

## Games

1. **Simple Countdown Timer** - Pick a number and watch it count down to zero
2. **Guess the Countdown** - Try to guess what number the countdown started from
3. **Stop at Zero Challenge** - Press Enter at exactly the right moment when it hits zero

## How to Play

1. Make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed
2. Download or clone this repo
3. Run the game:
```
python countdown_game.py
```
4. Choose which game you want to play from the menu

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- That's it! Uses only built-in modules (`time` and `random`)

## Files

- `countdown_game.py` - All three games in one file
- `README.md` - You're reading it

Have fun and see if you can beat your own records!
